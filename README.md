# DiscordBotMath
We present ReMBot, the Recreational Mathematics Bot, for Discord. 
Discord is a free communication platform that allows users to create _bots_, 
automated chatbots that can perform pre-defined tasks. When added to a server, ReMBot will allow the user to
 enter commands to solve mathematical puzzles and games. The first puzzle is given below

## Setup and Run
1. Create a folder to store a local version of this repo on your machine
2. Clone the repo to your local machine via the command `git clone https://github.com/TheRogueDalek/DiscordBotMath.git`
3. Create a discord account [here](https://discordapp.com/)
4. Join our server dedicated to testing ReMBot [here](https://discord.gg/awFeeb5)
5. Run ReMBot.py on your local machine. On the command line, this is done by going to the _DiscordMathBot_ directory and running the command `python ReMBot.py`
6. Check on the testing server that ReMBot is online by clicking on "Member List" in the top-right of Discord
7. Run one of the commands the ReMBot recognizes. Currently, only the command `$chocolate` is implemented.
8. Follow ReMBot's instructions and having fun with math!
